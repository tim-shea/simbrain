        <h1>Agents </h1>
        <p><img src="../../../Images/Mouse.gif" width="32" height="32"> An agent is a creature in Odor World that can be controlled by a neural network. The neural network can be thought of as the brain of the agent; without a network controlling the agent, it does nothing. For a network to control an agent, it must be <a href="../../Workspace/Couplings.html">coupled</a> to an agent's sensors and effectors. To get started understanding how agent sensors and effectors work see the <a href="Couplings_Overview.html">couplings overview</a> page.</p>  

        <p>Effectors are the motor controls of an agent, like moving forward or backward, and turning left or right. An agent's input sensors abstractly model reaction to stimuli, though they were created with olfaction in mind.</p>

        <p>Agents are a special kind of Odor World <a href="objects.html">object</a>, and inherit all of their properties, including the ability to act as a source of smells.</p>
